sentence=Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithms: crc8, crc16ccitt, crc16modbus, crc32.
paragraph=Programmatically converted from C99 code generated by https://pycrc.org to Arduino C++. For each CRC algorithm, 4 variants are available: The 'bit' variant uses brute force bit-by-bit loop (smallest and slowest); the 'nibble' variant uses a 4-bit table (potentially good balance between size and speed); `nibblem` variant is the same as `nibble` but 1.9X-2.7X faster on the ESP8266; and the 'byte' variant uses an 8-bit table (largest but fastest).
