sentence=Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithms (crc8, crc16ccitt, crc32) programmatically converted from C99 code generated by pycrc (https://pycrc.org) to Arduino C++ using namespaces and PROGMEM flash memory.
paragraph=For each algorithm, 4 implementation variants have been generated: The 'bit' variant uses brute force bit-by-bit loop (smallest and slowest); the 'nibble' variant uses a 4-bit table (potentially good balance between size and speed); `nibblem` variant is the same as `nibble` but 1.9X-2.7X faster on the ESP8266; and the 'byte' variant uses an 8-bit table (largest but fastest).
